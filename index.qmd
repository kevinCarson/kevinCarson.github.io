:::{#hero-heading}

I am a PhD candidate at the [ University of Arizonaâ€™s School of Sociology](https://sociology.arizona.edu/).

As a sociologist, I have a broad substantive interest in examining patterns of **criminal behavior** and **international migration**. Recently, I've begun to examine predictors of drug-trafficking related homicide rates in Mexico from 2000 to 2022. I also have a strong methodological interest in advancing methods for the analysis of **social networks**, especially methods for the analysis of two-mode networks.

At the intersection of my substantive interests, my recent master's paper examined the social process of coyotaje at U.S.-Mexico Border from 1994 to 2010 to understand how past migratory experiences can reduce the uncertainty of the illicit market of coyotes for autonomous migrants, given the increasing militarization of the U.S.-Mexico border. Recently, I've begun an analysis of relational predictors of drug-trafficking related homicides in Mexico from 2000 to 2022. 

I am a strong advocate for open science. In particular, as a proponent of open science, I 1) make all code for replicating analyses from my peer-reviewed articles publicly [available](https://github.com/kevinCarson), 2) upload teaching materials on statistical models most commonly used in sociology, and 3) actively work on developing functions for the free and open-access statistical software [R](https://cran.r-project.org/).
