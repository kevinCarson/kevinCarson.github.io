<summary>Abstract</summary>
The literature on undocumented migration at the US-Mexico border implicitly assumes that the probability of migrants using a coyote on
a current trip should be negatively associated with their migratory experience, measured as the number of prior undocumented crossings
a migrant has undertaken. Put simply, the literature assumes that experienced undocumented migrants crossing the border should be less
likely to use a coyote . This paper provides evidence to reconsider that assumption using data from undocumented border crossings by
men between 1994 and 2010. Empirically, we report robust evidence showing that, at any level of migratory experience, once a migrant
uses a coyote to cross the US-Mexico border, he is likely to keep using a coyote in future trips. Theoretically, we develop a framework to
incorporate coyote use into the theory of migration-specific human capital. Given the contemporary era of militarisation and
criminalisation of the US-Mexico border and the increasing power of criminal organisations operating at the border, we develop a
discussion of the importance of prior coyote use as an undertheorized form of migration-specific human capital.
