This article is an examination of autonomous migrants self-reported utilization of a coyote at the U.S. Mexico border from 1994 to 2010, during which the border became increasingly uncertain for migrants due to the militarization by the U.S. Border Patrol and the advent of border bandits and criminal groups.
